## Time

- Total time: ~3 hours
- I am not finished with this lab, I need to finish out the testing suite for errors and the validator middleware. I will work on those Friday, 15 July.

## Lessons Learned

- I learned a little bit about how the error handling modules were working, and firing when the correct errors were being used---for instance including a 4th argument for the 500 error. I also learned about middleware failing on a certain endpoint, because the middleware was firing before the route of the path was being read. Other than that, I know I really need to focus on understanding the testing methodology and syntax more.
