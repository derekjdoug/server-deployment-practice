## Time

- Total time: ~5 hours
- Testing suite needs to be continued to be built out more.

## Lessons Learned

- This was a really fun lab. I enjoyed building out the CRUD and experimenting with sequelize. I actually thought the syntax for these functions were pretty manageable. Experimenting with the HTTP methods in ThunderClient was a really beneficial experience and strengthened my understanding of how everything works together. The biggest adventure there was in getting update and delete to work. Good practice for diving into the docs for trouble shooting!
