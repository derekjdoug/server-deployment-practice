## Lab 04: Data Modeling

## Author: Derek "Dougie" Douglas

## Collaborators: David Southard, Zayah Lang, Luis Sandoval

- Big shout out to Zayah Lang, who helped steer me in the right direction for this lab when I was feeling lost. I modeled my Collection after how she wrote hers, to include the routing. She also helped me fix a bug that I would have encountered in the routing with needed to use anonymous arrow functions instead of this.(blank).

## Time

- Total time: ~5 hours
- Testing suite needs to be continued to be built out more.

## Lessons Learned

- Wowweee, this lab ended up being difficult. Not that what we were doing was extremely hard to code, but it was very abstract as we're not looking at the models and DBs we're creating in a GUI at the same time. I think we probably needed just a touch more of an example of what the end product should do/look like in this lab. That being said, a lot of help came from other devs in getting to the end point. This just shows that you need to work together and rely on the knowledge and assistance of your team.
